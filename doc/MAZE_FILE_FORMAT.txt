The format of the .maz files is as follows:

1) Each .maz file consists of MAZE_WIDTH * MAZE_HEIGHT newline-separated lines
2) Each line consists of 6 whitespace (preferably single-space) separated tokens
3) Each of the 6 tokens are integer values
4) The first 2 tokens represent the x and y position of the tile, respectively
5) The last 4 tokens represent the existence of north, east, south, and west walls, respectively
6) A "1" indicates the presence of wall, while a "0" indicates the absence of a wall
7) The lines should be sorted in order of their x values, and then subsorted in order of their y values

Thus, a valid 3x2 maze file might look like:

0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0
2 0 1 1 1 0
2 1 1 1 1 0

And the maze corresponding to the file would look like:

|---------------------------------------------|
|                                             |
|                                             |
|                                             |
|     (0,1)           (1,1)         (2,1)     |
|                                             |
|                                             |
|                              ---------------|
|               |                             |
|               |                             |
|               |                             |
|     (0,0)     |     (1,0)         (2,0)     |
|               |                             |
|               |                             |
|---------------|-----------------------------|

A few notes:

1) The length of each row of the maze must be the same.
2) The presence/absence of walls must be consistent between rows. That is, if a wall is present
   to the north of a particular tile, it should also be present to the south of the tile directly
   above the first tile.
3) In order for a maze file to be valid, the maze must be bounded on all sides.
