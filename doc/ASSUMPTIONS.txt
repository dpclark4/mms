Differential Drive
------------------
- Two wheeled
- Both wheels are parallel
- Both wheels are perpendicular to the line that connects their centerpoints
- The motors are mounted opposite - that is, a counter-clockwise rotation of the
  left wheel will pull the robot forward, which a counter-clockwise rotation of the
  right wheel will pull the robot backwards.
- For a discrete interface, we assume that the mouse can rotate freely in a square
